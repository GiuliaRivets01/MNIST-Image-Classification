# MNIST-Image-Classification
This assignment is part of the course *Introduction to Deep Learning*.

In this assignment, we developed and evaluateed several algorithms for classifying images of handwritten digits and designing our own neural network from scratch for the XOR problem. The dataset considered is a simplified version of the famous MNIST data set: a collection of 2707 digits represented by 16x16 vectors.

## Task 1
Here we used dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, U-MAP, T-SNE) to visualize the data. Then we have implemented the Nearest mean classifier as well as the KNN (K-Nearest-Neighbor) classifier, comparing their performances.

## Task 2
In task 2 we implemenyted a multi-class perceptron training algorithm and used it for training a single layer perceptron with 10 nodes (one per digit), each node having 256+1 inputs (inputs and bias) and 1 output.

## Task 3
Here we implemented a neural network performing the XOR function.
